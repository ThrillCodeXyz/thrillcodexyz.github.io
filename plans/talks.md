# Rules for Scheduled Talks

## Rule #1: Most talks/lectures/panels/breakout sessions must be limited to ride queues.

This is the conference pitch, the big one.

Ride queues are great, natural limiters on a talk. They encourage a close,
familial audience. They have a set endpoint: a ride; a bit of merriment.

Ride queues are bit of a buy-in and semi-captive; they can feel hard to
escape.

No line? Short talk.

Don't like a talk? Good thing there is a ride at the end.

### Corollary: Talks may be bitter

Talks might be on the angrier or rantier side than is typical for most
cons.

Get it all out, then let a ride wash it away. Whee!

TODO: Maybe push the metaphor and force angry/ranty talks to the water park?
